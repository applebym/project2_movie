# Project 2 - Predicting The Decay Rate of a Movie's Box Office Revenue

For this project, I created a linear regression model with sci-kit learn and statsmodels to predict the decay rate of a filmâ€™s weekly box office revenue, using movie data scraped from the web via beautifulsoup. A model of this type would be able to add value to many players in the movies space, such as movie producers, studios, movie theaters, etc.
