# Project 2 - Predicting The Decay Rate of a Movie's Box Office Revenue

For this project, I am using linear regression to find if there is a relationship between the decay rate of a movie's weekly revenues (my independant variable) and a movie's attributes, and if there is, which attributes are most relevant. A model of this type would be able to add value to many players in the movies space, such as movie producers, studios, movie theaters, etc.
